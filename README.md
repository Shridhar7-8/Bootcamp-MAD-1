# Bootcamp-MAD-I

This project is a Flask-based web application that allows users to register, log in, create, edit, delete, flag, unflag, and search for posts. It includes user authentication, session management, and post management functionalities, including the ability to search posts by title and user ID.

In terms of control:

Controllers: have defined routes (views) for each feature, such as user registration, login, and post management (create, edit, delete, flag, unflag).
Authentication: User login and registration are handled using Flask forms, with password hashing for security. The user session is maintained to track login status.
Post Management: Posts are created, updated, deleted, flagged, and unflagged by users. The system enforces that users can only edit or delete their own posts.
Search and Summary: Users can search posts by title or user ID, and a summary of posts per user is visualized using a bar graph.
The application handles various user actions and displays corresponding messages to guide the user through different tasks like registration, login, or post-management.

The "control" part refers to ensuring the application correctly handles user inputs, manages user sessions, enforces access restrictions (e.g., only allowing users to edit or delete their own posts), and provides feedback to the user through flash messages.

In summary, this is a basic social media-like application with user registration, post management, and search features, including data visualization for post statistics.
